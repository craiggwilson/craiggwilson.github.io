I've been meaning to start blogging again for some time.  For some reason, I just can't get into the habit.  I love writing and, although I don't claim to be good at it, it's something I want to do.  Most of my hangups thus far have mostly been around not thinkg I had anything to share.  I think a new tact should be taken.  

My [old blog](http://craiggwilson.wordpress.com) was on wordpress and was just a pain to format, syntax highlighting, etc... This new one is based on [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and is super easy to build, write new posts, and github pages hosts it for me.

As I work on things, day-to-day, I'll keep notes.  Things I struggle with are probably things other people have struggled with. I'll jot down how I solved the problems, if I did, for them to server as a reminder to me and hopefully a help to others.

Let's see how this goes.
