I am a developer out of Dallas, TX where I have a wonderful family complete with 3 kids. I volunteer at my [local church](http://www.pcbc.org) teaching high school students. Mostly, I've worked in Microsoft based enterprises functioning in roles from developer to architect to consultant.  Currently, I work for [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) building the awesome open-source database [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org).
